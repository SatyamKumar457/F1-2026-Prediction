# 🏎️ F1 2026 Race Prediction

Machine Learning project that predicts Formula 1 race outcomes using historical race data, telemetry metrics, and team performance indicators.

This project uses data from previous seasons (primarily 2024–2025) to train a model that predicts race performance for the **2026 Formula 1 season**.

The goal is to explore how data science and machine learning can be applied to motorsport analytics.

## 📢 Race Predictions Updates

I will be posting the **predictions for every Formula 1 Grand Prix of the 2026 season on LinkedIn**.

Each post will include:
- 🏎️ Predicted race results
- 📊 Model predictions vs actual race results
- 📈 Accuracy analysis
- 🔧 Improvements made to the model during the season

Follow the updates here:

🔗 LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyam-kumar-a01959326/

This project will evolve throughout the season as the model improves with more race data.

## 📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore:

- Whether **machine learning can predict Formula 1 race outcomes**
- How **driver pace, team performance, and qualifying results** influence race performance
- How **model performance changes when regulations or competitive order shift**

The project predicts race times for each driver, which are then used to determine the predicted race order and podium.

## 📥 Data Sources

The project uses:

- **FastF1 API** for telemetry and session data
- Historical race results
- Lap time data
- Qualifying session data
- Driver and constructor information

---

## 1. Australia Grand Prix 2026 🇦🇺

---

## 🧠 Features Used

The model currently uses the following features:

- Qualifying Time
- Clean Air Race Pace
- Team Performance Score
- Previous race performance indicators
- DNF / Non-participation indicators

These features aim to represent both driver pace and team competitiveness.

---

## 🤖 Model

The current model uses:

**XGBoost Regressor**

The model predicts:
PredictedRaceTime (seconds)


Drivers are then ranked based on predicted race time to estimate finishing order.

---

## 📈 Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**

Predictions are compared against real race results to measure accuracy.

---

| Driver | Predicted Position | Actual Position |
|------|------|------|
| RUS | 1 | 1 |
| PIA | 2 | DNF |
| NOR | 3 | 5 |

- **MAE (Based on 2025) :- 8.51(s)**
- **MAE (Based on 2026) :- 1047(s)**

This large error occurred because **Formula 1 introduced major regulation changes in 2026**, which drastically altered:

- Car design
- Team competitiveness
- Performance hierarchy

Because of this, *historical race data (2023–2025)* became much less reliable for predicting *2026 performance*.
---
## 2. China Grand Prix 2026 🇨🇳

---

## 🧠 Features Used

The model currently uses the following features:

- FP 1/2/3 Best Time
- Sector 1/2/3 Time
- Average Lap Time
- Stint
- Tyre Data
- Qualifying Time

These features aim to represent both driver pace and team competitiveness.
---

## 🤖 Model

The current model uses:

**Random Forest Regressor**

The model predicts:
Final Standing


Drivers are then ranked based on Final Standing to estimate finishing order.

---

## 📈 Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:

- **Spearman Rank**

Predictions are compared against real race results to measure accuracy.

---

| Driver | Predicted Position | Actual Position |
|------|------|------|
| ANT | 1 | 1 |
| RUS | 2 | 2 |
| LEC | 3 | 4 |

- **Spearman Rank (Based on Australia 2026) :- 0.80**
- **MAE (Based on China 2026) :- 0.46**

---
## 🔧 Improvements

Future model improvements will include:

- Team Performance
- Weather Factor
- Current season team performance
- More ... 

The goal is simple:  **Imporve the Model after every race using new Data and Features**.
---

## 📊 Example Visualization

The project also includes visualizations comparing:

- Predicted vs Actual race results
- Feature importance
- Model performance

Example plots include:

- Feature importance graphs
- Predicted vs Actual finishing order
- Race pace distributions
