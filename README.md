# 🏎️ F1 2026 Race Prediction

Machine Learning project that predicts Formula 1 race outcomes using historical race data, telemetry metrics, and team performance indicators.

This project uses data from previous seasons (primarily 2024–2025) to train a model that predicts race performance for the **2026 Formula 1 season**.

The goal is to explore how data science and machine learning can be applied to motorsport analytics.

---
## 📢 Race Predictions Updates

I will be posting the **predictions for every Formula 1 Grand Prix of the 2026 season on LinkedIn**.

Each post will include:
- 🏎️ Predicted race results
- 📊 Model predictions vs actual race results
- 📈 Accuracy analysis
- 🔧 Improvements made to the model during the season

Follow the updates here:

🔗 LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/satyam-kumar-a01959326/

This project will evolve throughout the season as the model improves with more race data.

## 📊 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore:

- Whether **machine learning can predict Formula 1 race outcomes**
- How **driver pace, team performance, and qualifying results** influence race performance
- How **model performance changes when regulations or competitive order shift**

The project predicts race times for each driver, which are then used to determine the predicted race order and podium.

- **MAE (Based on 2026) :- 1047(s)**
- **Spearman Rank (Based on Australia 2026) :- 0.59**

This large error occurred because **Formula 1 introduced major regulation changes in 2026**, which drastically altered:

- Car design
- Team competitiveness
- Performance hierarchy

Because of this, historical race data (2023–2025) became much less reliable for predicting 2026 performance.
